                            Co-founded Shredit Studio and developed Shredits, a mobile app for viewing, rating and uploading short ski and snowboard videos. The app was developed using <code>React Native</code> and successfully released to the <code>Apple App Store</code> in January 2016. The Android version is currently in beta test. I also developed the back end services to support the app, using <code>Node.js</code> and <code>Postgres</code>. I created the infrastructure for the services, using <code>AWS</code>, <code>Docker</code> and <code>Elastic Container Service</code>. Other responsibilities I have at Shredit Studio are business direction and meeting with potential business partners along with my other Co-founder.

                            Designed and developed a greenfield project to create a European focused hub for the medical community. This involved heavy interaction with the product team, based in Didcot, to gather requirements for the product. Implemented using <code>React</code> and <code>Bootstrap</code> on the front end, and <code>Node.js microservices</code> on the backend. We made heavy usage of <code>React</code>'s <code>Server Side Rendering</code> ability to make our pages quick and responsive. We used <code>react-router</code> to handle routing. All our microservices were deployed as <code>Docker</code> containers onto a <code>Mesos</code> infrastructure for <code>zero downtime deployments</code>. I developed a <code>Hubot</code> chat bot so any member of staff could deploy changes through the environments.

                            Created a Point of Sale product customiser app for <code>iOS</code> using <code>Phonegap</code> and <code>Angular</code>. This app is loaded onto iPads and then sent to various stockists for customers to customise ski goggles which can then be bought in store. Due to budget constraints by the business, we used old iPad 1 models so the app had to be performant and work around browser features missing in iOS5. Later this app was converted from using Angular to be <code>React</code> based. I was also responsible for updating and integrating <code>eStore</code> functionality into an existing <code>Wordpress</code> codebase.

                            Working with a product team based in Melbourne, Australia, I created a simple Proof of Concept <code>iOS</code> app that was shown to potential investors. Once we had project signoff, we pivoted from mobile to web and I created a fully functional car rental website using <code>Angular</code> with a <code>Node.js</code> backend using <code>Parse PaaS</code> for data persistence. The services ran on <code>Heroku</code> and these were deployed weekly for business and investor approval. I also had regular product meetings with the team in Australia via <code>Skype</code> to gather requirements and to give product updates.

                            Developed a responsible gambling app prototype for use in high street bookmakers. The app used <code>Bluetooth iBeacon</code> technology and was a hybrid app using <code>Angular</code> and <code>Phonegap</code>. Due to external time pressure, the app was developed by a team of 4 engineers in 2 weeks ready to present to investors. After discussion by the team we decided to ditch the hybrid approach and build the app using native <code>iOS</code> and <code>Android</code> frameworks. The app was supported by a <code>Java 8</code> <code>Dropwizard</code> based microservice architecture.

                            Developed a set of <code>Node.js</code> services to support an education based <code>iOS</code> game. The services handled account creation and authentication, game progress tracking and content subscription with a versioned API to provide backwards compatibility to older versions of the app. The services also integrated with <code>Apple App Store</code> to verify <code>In App Purchases</code>. The services were deployed to <code>AWS</code> using <code>Puppet</code> to handle server provisioning.

                            Oversaw and developed a project to migrate the <code>Moshi Monsters</code> web stack from a legacy <code>Java</code> and <code>Struts</code> based webapp to a focused <code>Node.js</code> service written in <code>Coffeescript</code>. The new service could comfortably handle 30k concurrent users at peak times. I brought in a member of the ops team to work closely with our developers so that there was good communication about the changes to the system architecture. Out of this collaboration we implemented a one click deployment process that allowed our product team to get features out to production easily and often.

                            At my time at Gamesys I was involved with developing many of the core services used by the gaming platform such as Payments, Virtual Wallet, Bonus Campaigns and the Poker Game Engine. These services utilised a number of legacy technologies such as <code>Java</code>, <code>JBoss</code>, <code>Hibernate</code> and <code>Spring</code>, as well as newer technologies that had been introduced, like <code>Ruby on Rails</code>, <code>Active MQ</code>, <code>Mongo</code> and <code>HTML5</code>. I was promoted to become the Technical Lead for the web team and oversaw a complete platform rewrite from <code>JSP</code> to <code>Tapestry 5</code>. This rewrite allowed the business to quickly create new partner sites and affiliates and was greatly received by the commercial team. Following this project I was then involved in a new project to create an online Poker platform. This project included remote and on-site work with another technical team in Vancouver, Canada.
